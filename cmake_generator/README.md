# cmake_generator
Generate CMakeLists.txt automatically from minimal descriptions in Python.

I don't like CMake Language. I don't like working with it, and I don't like the way it wants you to define your projects. So instead of making a library in CMake Language itself, I chose to write a code generator in Python. An example of how I use this in a project is [Shake](https://github.com/berryvansomeren/shake3/), my hobby programming framework. This is still a work in progress.
