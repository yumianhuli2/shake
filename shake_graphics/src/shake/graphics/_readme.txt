The draw module is like a convenience wrapper around graphics and content.
It provides some functions that make it easy to draw things,
without having to load the graphics primitives, and call the the appropriate render functions yourself.
The draw module therefore relies on:
- core         | for data structures and algorithms
- content      | for loading content
- graphics     | for drawing content
